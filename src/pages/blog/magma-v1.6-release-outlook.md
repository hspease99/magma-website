Following a successful v1.5 release, the stage has been set for further work to continue to grow the platform, add to the feature set and expand support to new use-cases.

The 1.5 release was significant for a couple of reasons:
1. Ubuntu became the default distribution and with that a kernel upgrade to version 5.4
2. Inbound roaming and Intra-AGW S1 Mobility were enabled in this release
3. Other notable network restriction features enabled included IMEI and PLMN restriction via simple configuration

The next release (v1.6), targeted for the end of the half will represent a major move forward towards the growth, maturity and enrichment of the Magma platform and community. The planned work is organized into the following themes and focus areas. The details are available publicly in Zenhub.
